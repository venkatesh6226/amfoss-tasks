I have worked very hard for this task but I am not able to finish the entire task. My bot is not able to fetch the movie information. i have no idea where to add the omdb api. I have referred various internet sources but i am not able to figure it out. Sorry for this 😔. I created the bot using botfather and inserted the key in bot.py code, when i run the code bot is working but it can only respond to the messages, but it is not able to fetch information about movies.
