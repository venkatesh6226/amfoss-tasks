It was a bit confusing. After reading the instructions i came to know that basic commands of git is required fot this task. So i learnt basic commands of git. By following the instructions i found the contents of “part1.txt”, “part2.txt”, “part3.txt”. I have commited all the work i did to main branch. After following the next steps, I found the file name “Athens”, Now i have the contents of “part4.txt”. Now i copied the parts to folder named solution. Now i merged all these parts and named is as password.txt. The content of the password.txt is the password for the secret pdf.
